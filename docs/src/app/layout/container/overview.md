Containers are used to add [margin](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/spacing#0678ba2e-1bce-49b8-8591-e471d6417011) to content.

Universal material comes with two different containers:

- `.container`, which sets a `max-width` to the container
- `.container-fluid`, which is `width: 100%`
